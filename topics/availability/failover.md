# Failover, mitigation and planning

**Failover** is a technique used to ensure high **[availability][1]** of a system. It is the process of automatically switching to a standby system in case the primary system fails or becomes unavailable. Failover is a key component of a disaster recovery plan, and it helps ensure that systems remain available during an outage and minimize downtime.

There are different types of failover, including:

1. **Active-passive** ***failover***: In this type, there is a primary system that handles all requests, while a secondary system is idle and waiting for the primary system to fail. When the primary system fails, the secondary system takes over and becomes active.

**Active-active** ***failover***: In this type, there are multiple active systems, each handling a portion of the traffic. If one system fails, the traffic is automatically redirected to the remaining active systems.

To implement failover, you need to have redundant systems and a mechanism for detecting the failure of the primary system. You also need to have a way of redirecting traffic to the standby system, and this is typically done using load balancers or DNS failover.

There are different strategies for mitigating failover, including:

1. **Testing**: Regularly testing the failover system to ensure it works as expected.

1. **Monitoring**: Monitoring the system to detect potential issues before they become problems.

3. **Redundancy**: Ensuring that all critical components of the system are redundant, so that if one component fails, another can take over seamlessly.

4. **Automation**: Automating the failover process as much as possible to minimize downtime and human error.

5. **Documentation**: Creating detailed documentation of the failover process, so that everyone involved knows exactly what to do in case of a failure.

Failover is a process that enables a standby or backup system to take over the responsibilities of a primary system in the event that the primary system fails. This process is essential to ensuring high availability of a system, as the backup system can take over the responsibilities of the primary system quickly and seamlessly.

There are several components involved in a failover system:

1. **Primary System**: The primary system is the system that handles all requests and is the main point of contact for users.

2. **Standby System**: The standby system is a backup system that is ready to take over the responsibilities of the primary system in case of a failure.

3. **Failover Mechanism**: The failover mechanism is the process that detects when the primary system has failed and triggers the standby system to take over.

4. **Redundancy**: Redundancy is the practice of having multiple redundant components, such as servers or databases, so that if one component fails, another can take over seamlessly.

To implement failover, you need to have redundant systems and a mechanism for detecting the failure of the primary system. You also need to have a way of redirecting traffic to the standby system, and this is typically done using load balancers or DNS failover.
