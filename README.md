When designing a high-level architecture for a scalable system, there are several factors to consider, such as:

1. High availability: The system should be designed to have minimal downtime, even in the event of hardware failure, software bugs, or other issues.

1. Scalability: The system should be able to handle increasing loads without compromising performance or reliability.

1. Fault tolerance: The system should be able to withstand failures in individual components and still operate.

1. Data consistency: The system should maintain consistency and integrity of data across multiple nodes in a distributed environment.

1. Security: The system should be designed with security best practices to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.

Some common design patterns that can help achieve these goals include:

1. Load balancing: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource usage and minimize downtime.

2. Replication: Duplicating data to multiple nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

2. Caching: Storing frequently used data in memory to improve performance and reduce the load on backend services.

2. Sharding: Splitting data into smaller chunks and distributing them across multiple servers to improve scalability and reduce the risk of data loss.

2. Asynchronous processing: Separating processes that can be performed asynchronously, such as sending emails or processing long-running tasks, to improve performance and scalability.

These are just a few of the many factors to consider and patterns to use when designing high-level architecture for scalable systems. Let me know if you have any specific questions or scenarios you'd like me to cover.

## Design a large-scale system

The biggest question while designing a large scale system is of scalability. That is how smoothly and how quickly a system can grow.

I have discussed [Scalability][1] in depth [here][1].
